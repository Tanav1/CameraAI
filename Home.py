How can real and fake images be distinguished?
Should our model use only images as input, or a combination of images and text prompts?
How does model the perform on images significantly different from the training data, e.g., faces, and should the model be fine-tuned on additional data to perform better?
How can we deploy the model and interactively demo it during our presentation?
